        <h2 id="who">Who runs it</h2>
        <p>
          hrva.cc is a non-commercial hobby project of <a href="https://hrvalabs.net/">HrvaLabs</a>, run since 2022 by{" "}
          <a href={AUTHOR_URL} rel="author">{AUTHOR_NAME}</a>, a software engineer from Zagreb. There is no company,
          team or investor behind it. The code is on{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/karlohrvacic">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          hrva.cc is also the domain the other <a href={PUBLISHER_URL}>HrvaLabs</a> apps live under, such as garage.hrva.cc
          and gableci.hrva.cc.
        </p>

        <h2 id="why">Why it works the way it does</h2>
        <p>
          Counting visits doesn&apos;t require knowing who your visitors are, so hrva.cc doesn&apos;t keep that. Link
          statistics are daily totals, unique visitors are counted with a one-way hash under a key that changes every
          day, and visitors&apos; IP addresses are never stored (<Link href="/privacy-first-url-shortener">how visits are counted</Link>). Shortening works without an account, and a free account
          adds custom aliases, visit limits, expiry dates, passwords, analytics, API keys, bio pages and notifications.
        </p>

        <h2 id="money">How it is paid for</h2>
        <p>
          It isn&apos;t a business. There are no paid plans and no ads, there are no third-party trackers, and personal
          data is not sold. The <Link href="/terms">terms of use</Link> say it is provided free of charge and as is.
        </p>

        <h2 id="where">Where it runs</h2>
        <p>
          The API, its database and its cache run on Oracle Cloud in Frankfurt, Germany (EU). The web app and the short
          links are delivered through Cloudflare. The <Link href="/privacy">privacy policy</Link> lists every service
          that handles data for hrva.cc, and what each one sees.
        </p>
