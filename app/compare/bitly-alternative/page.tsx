          hrva.cc is a free, open-source URL shortener with no paid plans and no ads. Compared with Bitly&apos;s Free plan,
          it has no monthly cap on links, custom aliases or QR codes, and it keeps only daily totals about clicks, with no
          IP addresses. Bitly is the better choice when you need your own domain, a team account or its integrations.

          <li>Several people need to share one account with permissions. hrva.cc accounts are for one person.</li>

            You rely on its extras, such as integrations with other apps, mobile deep linking, browser extensions and mobile
            apps, which its pricing page lists.
