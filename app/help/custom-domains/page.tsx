                <li>
                  Once the domain is <strong>{DOMAIN_STATUS_LABELS.ACTIVE}</strong>, select <strong>New URL</strong>{" "}
                  on your <Link href="/dashboard">URLs page</Link>, or use the form on the home page while signed
                  in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In <strong>Domain</strong>, pick your domain. It starts on hrva.cc, and shows only once you have
                  an active domain.
                </li>
                <li>Shorten the link as usual. It opens at go.example.com and its alias.</li>
              </ol>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Aliases are separate for each domain: go.example.com/menu and hrva.cc/menu can be two different
                  links, and hrva.cc/menu may belong to someone else.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A link&apos;s domain is set when you create it and can&apos;t be changed later.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stats, visit limits, passwords, expiry, QR codes and the safety checks work the same as on
                  hrva.cc. A QR code opens your domain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  With the API, send your domain&apos;s name as <code>domain</code> when you create a link.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Only short links work on your domain. The root, go.example.com/, opens the hrva.cc home page,
                  and anything else on your domain, such as a bio page, answers <strong>Not found</strong>.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2 id="why-no-root">Why root domains aren&apos;t supported yet</h2>
              <p>
                A custom domain works through a CNAME record. A root domain like example.com can&apos;t have a
                CNAME record at most DNS providers, because it already holds other records, such as the ones for
                your email. Some providers get around this with CNAME flattening, but not all do, so for now
                hrva.cc takes subdomains only. A subdomain like go.example.com leaves your website and email as
                they are.
              </p>

              <h2 id="remove">Remove a domain</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  In <Link href={SETTINGS_HREF}>Settings</Link>, under <strong>Custom domains</strong>, select{" "}
                  <strong>Remove</strong> next to the domain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If it has links, choose under <strong>What happens to its links?</strong>:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>{LINK_MODE_LABELS.DEACTIVATE}</strong> (picked to start with):{" "}
                      {LINK_MODE_HINTS.DEACTIVATE}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>{LINK_MODE_LABELS.MOVE}</strong>: {LINK_MODE_HINTS.MOVE}
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Select <strong>Remove domain</strong>. It says <strong>Removed go.example.com.</strong>, with how
                  many links were moved or turned off.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Removing can&apos;t be undone. The links stop working on your domain at once, whichever you
                choose, so printed QR codes and shared links that use your domain stop working too. Links you turn
                off can&apos;t be turned back on, because their domain is gone. Once it&apos;s removed, you can
                delete the CNAME record at your DNS provider.
              </p>
              <p>
                An admin can also remove a domain, with the same two choices, and you get an email when that
                happens.
              </p>

              <h2 id="privacy">Custom domains and your privacy</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Visitors who open links on your domain get the same privacy as on hrva.cc: daily counts only, and
                  their IP addresses are never stored.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cloudflare receives your domain&apos;s name, to issue and renew its certificate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Certificates are published in public Certificate Transparency logs, so your domain&apos;s name
                  becomes public once it&apos;s set up, even if you never share a link.
                </li>
