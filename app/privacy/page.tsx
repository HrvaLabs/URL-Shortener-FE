              <h2>What we collect and why</h2>

              <h3>Account data</h3>
              <p>
                When you register, we process your email address, an optional display name, and your
                password, which is stored only as a salted one-way hash. If you sign in with Google,
                we receive your name and email address from that account instead of a password. If
                you sign in with GitHub, we receive your public profile (username and name) and the
                email addresses on the account instead of a password; hrva.cc uses only the verified
                primary one. Two-step verification is available whether you sign in with a password,
                Google or GitHub. If you turn it on, we store the shared secret of your authenticator
                app, if you use one, and one-way hashes of your recovery codes, so we can verify your
                codes. If you add a passkey or security key, we store its public key and a few
                details: the name you give it, when it was added and last used, which connection types
                it supports (such as USB or NFC), whether it&apos;s synced between your devices, and its
                model identifier when the device shares one. We also keep the technical data needed to
                check it when you sign in, such as its credential ID, a sign-in counter and the data
                your device sent when you added it. We also store a random identifier that
                links your passkeys to your account. Your fingerprint, face or PIN never leaves your
                device, and hrva.cc never receives it. When you add a passkey, we email you a security
                notice. We also record when your account was created and when you last logged in.
              </p>
              <p>
                Which ways you&apos;ve signed in (email and password, passkey, Google or GitHub) and
                when you last used each. Deleted with your account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Legal basis: performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) — this data is required to
                provide your account.
              </p>

              <h3>Link statistics (visitors who open short links)</h3>
              <p>
                When someone opens a short link, hrva.cc adds to that link&apos;s counts for the day.
                For each link and day it keeps only totals: clicks, unique visitors, clicks from bots
                and link previews, and how many clicks came from each referring site&apos;s domain
                (for example t.co), each country, each device type (mobile, tablet or desktop), each
                browser and operating system family, and whether the click came from a QR code made by
                hrva.cc. The country comes from Cloudflare, which
                carries our traffic; we don&apos;t look up locations ourselves. Full addresses of
                referring pages, full browser identifiers and IP addresses are never stored, and
                nothing is recorded about an individual click. Short links set no cookies and run no
                scripts.
              </p>
              <p>
                To count unique visitors, the visitor&apos;s IP address and browser identifier are
                combined with the link and a random key that changes every day, and turned into a
                one-way hash. The hashes and the day&apos;s key are kept only in Redis, never in our
                database, and expire a few hours after the day ends. Without the key the hashes
                can&apos;t be traced back to anyone, and because the key changes every day and the
                link is part of the hash, the same visitor can&apos;t be followed across days or
                across links. Link owners see only the daily totals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Legal basis: legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) — providing link owners with
                basic, privacy-preserving usage statistics and protecting the service from abuse.
              </p>

              <h3>Bio pages</h3>
              <p>
                If you create a bio page, we store what you enter for it: your handle, display name,
                bio, avatar choice (initials or an emoji), colour and theme, and which of your short
                links appear as buttons, with their titles, icons, order and whether each is shown,
                your search-engine setting, and when the page was created and last changed. Everything
                on the page is public at hrva.cc/@yourhandle, so add only what you want anyone to see.
                Your email address is never shown on the page. Search engines are asked not to list the
                page unless you turn on &quot;Allow search engines to index this page&quot;.
              </p>
              <p>
                When someone opens a bio page, their browser tells hrva.cc once that the page was
                viewed. We count each visitor at most once a day with the same one-way hash as link
                statistics: the IP address and browser identifier are combined with the page and a key
                that changes every day, kept only in Redis and deleted a few hours after the day ends.
                We store only daily totals per page: views, and views by bots. The page sets no cookies
                and loads no third-party scripts, fonts or trackers. Clicks on its buttons are ordinary
                short link clicks, counted as described above.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you change your handle or delete your page, we keep the old handle for 30 days, so
                nobody can take it to pretend to be you, and then delete it. Like links, a bio
                page&apos;s text (handle, name, bio and button titles) is checked automatically for brand
                names and phishing words; a hit sends the page to an admin, and the notes, any visitor
                reports, and an admin&apos;s reason for hiding the page or taking back its handle are
                kept with the page and deleted with it. Admin actions on a page, such as hiding it or
                taking back its handle, are also recorded in the admin audit log (see{" "}
                <a href="#security-and-audit-logs">Security and audit logs</a>). A handle an admin takes
                back is also kept on the reserved list, with the admin&apos;s reason but without a link
                to you, until an admin releases it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Legal basis: performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) for the page you publish;
                legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) for the view counts, for keeping old handles,
                and for checking and reviewing pages to protect visitors and the service from abuse.
              </p>

              <h3>Storage in your browser</h3>
              <p>
                We keep a few small items in your browser, only so the site works the way you asked,
                and none of them leaves your browser except the sign-in token, which is sent to
                hrva.cc with your requests:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  your sign-in token, in <em>localStorage</em>, so you stay signed in after you log in
                </li>
                <li>your light or dark theme choice, in <em>localStorage</em>, if you pick one</li>
                <li>
                  the last five campaign (UTM) tags you used, in <em>localStorage</em>, so the link
                  form can suggest them again
                </li>
                <li>
                  the page to return to after you sign in with Google or GitHub, in{" "}
                  <em>sessionStorage</em>, removed once you are back
                </li>
                <li>
                  after <em>Try again</em> on a bio page that couldn&apos;t load, that page&apos;s
                  handle, in <em>sessionStorage</em>, so keyboard focus can return to it; removed
                  straight away
                </li>
                <li>
                  a copy of the offline page, in the browser&apos;s cache storage, kept by hrva.cc&apos;s
                  service worker so the site can show it when you have no connection
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These are strictly necessary to provide the service you requested, which is why no
                consent banner is required for them (Art. 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive, implemented
                in Croatia by the Electronic Communications Act). We set no tracking cookies and use
                no analytics or advertising scripts. Fonts are self-hosted — your browser does not
                contact third-party font services.
              </p>

              <h3>Emails we send</h3>
              <p>
                We send transactional emails: address verification, password reset, security
                notices (for example when a passkey is added to your account), and a notice when one of
                your links is blocked or your account is deactivated, and notices about your custom domain when
                it&apos;s approved, not approved, turned off or removed by an admin. We also send the notification emails
                you turn on, as described under <a href="#notifications">Notifications</a>. We keep a log of
                emails sent to operate and troubleshoot delivery; for a notification email, the log also
                notes which notification it was. We do not send marketing email.
              </p>

              <h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>
              <p>
                If you turn on a notification email (dead links, the weekly summary or expiry reminders),
                we record when you turned it on and off, and how (in Settings or with an unsubscribe link).
                We keep that record as proof of your choice until you delete your account. Every such email
                has a one-click unsubscribe link.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you add a channel (Discord, Slack, Telegram, ntfy or your own webhook), we store its
                name, its address or token, which we encrypt, and the events you picked. A webhook&apos;s
                signing secret and an ntfy access token are encrypted too; a Telegram chat ID is stored as
                it is. For each event you pick, we keep the same record of when you turned it on and off,
                with the channel&apos;s type and name, also after you delete the channel. We send it only
                what you picked: counts of clicks, your short links, their destination hosts and dates. We
                never send visitors&apos; IP addresses, browsers or referrers, or your email address. Each
                channel&apos;s provider receives what we send under its own privacy terms; you choose them,
                and you can delete a channel at any time. We keep a record of each delivery for 30 days to
                retry failures and show you the last result.
              </p>
              <p>
                Legal basis: your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) for notification emails and channels;
                legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) for keeping the record of your consent.
              </p>

              <h3 id="custom-domains">Custom domains</h3>
              <p>
                If you apply for a custom domain, we store the domain, what you told us you&apos;ll use it for,
                the findings of the automatic safety checks on the domain, the admin&apos;s decision and notes
                (including why it was turned off, if it is), and the domain&apos;s setup status, including the id
                Cloudflare gives it, Cloudflare&apos;s status for it and the last error Cloudflare reported. We also store its dates: when you
                applied, and when it was reviewed, became active, was turned off or was removed. When you apply,
                and every night while it&apos;s active, the domain goes through the same checks as a link&apos;s
                destination, as described under <em>Keeping links safe</em>. Once it&apos;s approved, we send the
                domain&apos;s name to Cloudflare, which issues and renews its certificate. Certificates are
                published in public Certificate Transparency logs, so the name of your domain becomes public once
                it&apos;s set up. We keep this while the domain exists. When you remove it, or it isn&apos;t approved,
                its record stays, marked removed or not approved, until you delete your account. Visitors who open links
                on your domain get exactly the same privacy as visitors to hrva.cc: see &ldquo;Link
                statistics&rdquo;.
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                We keep internal audit logs of security-relevant events (such as logins and
                administrative actions) to protect the service and its users. Legal basis:
                legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
              </p>

              <h3>AI connectors</h3>
              <p>
                If you connect an AI app to your account through the hrva.cc MCP server, we store the
                app&apos;s registration and your authorization of it (token records) in the hrva.cc
                database until you disconnect the app in Settings → Connected apps or it goes
                unused for 30 days. We don&apos;t store the URLs and messages the app sends us
                beyond the links it creates.
              </p>
              <p>
                To limit abuse, new AI app registrations are rate-limited per network. For this we
                keep a hash of your IP address (for IPv6, of its network prefix) in our cache for at
                most an hour. The plain IP address is not stored.
              </p>
              <p>
                Legal basis: performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) — this is required to

              <h2>Keeping links safe</h2>
              <p>
                To protect visitors from phishing, malware and scams, we check where links lead when
                they are created or changed, and again later.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Blocklists</strong> — destinations are checked against public blocklists of
                  harmful domains and links. We download these lists and store them on hrva.cc&apos;s
                  own server, so this check sends nothing to anyone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Domain age</strong> — to learn when a destination&apos;s domain was
                  registered, we send the domain name to the domain registries (RDAP). Only the
                  domain name is sent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Spamhaus</strong> — when this check is enabled, the domain name may be
                  looked up in Spamhaus&apos;s domain blocklist through DNS. Only the domain name is
                  sent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Google Safe Browsing</strong> — receives the destination URL, as described
                  under <em>Who else receives data</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Redirects</strong> — the hrva.cc server may request a destination to follow
                  its redirects and check where they lead. The destination&apos;s server sees a request
                  from hrva.cc, never from the visitor, and no visitor data is sent.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Links that lead to known or very likely harmful sites are refused or disabled
                automatically. Automated checks can also flag a link for review, or mark an account
                as a possible scammer. The admin reviews flagged links and decides what happens to
                them, and the checks never block an account on their own.
              </p>
              <p>
                A weekly summary of site-wide totals, and an alert when many new links to the same new
                domain appear in a short time, go only to the admin and never identify a visitor. For
                links made without an account, the check behind that alert keeps a one-way hash of the

              <h3 id="link-checker">Checking destinations</h3>
              <p>
                At most once a night, hrva.cc&apos;s server (Oracle Cloud, Frankfurt) asks each active short
                link&apos;s destination whether it still exists, with a HEAD request or a small GET,
                identified as <code>hrva.cc-linkcheck/1.0</code>. It follows up to 5 redirects. It sends no
                cookies and no visitor data, and it doesn&apos;t count as a click. The result (when the
                destination was checked, how many nights it has failed, since when it looks dead, and a
                short status such as &ldquo;404&rdquo;) is stored with the link. The link&apos;s owner sees
                when its destination looks dead; for links made without an account, only the admin does.
              </p>
              <p>
                Legal basis: legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) &mdash; keeping short links working and
                showing their owners when a destination is gone.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Google Sign-In</strong> — only if you choose to log in with Google; Google
                  acts as your identity provider under its own privacy policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>GitHub</strong> — only if you choose to log in with GitHub; GitHub acts as
                  your identity provider under its own privacy policy.

                <li>
                  <strong>Google Safe Browsing</strong> — destination URLs you shorten, and the
                  addresses they redirect to, are checked against Google&apos;s threat database to
                  protect visitors from malicious sites, and so is the address of a custom domain you apply
                  for. Only the URL is sent, never information
                  about you or your visitors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Domain registries and Spamhaus</strong> — receive only the domain name of a
                  destination, or of a custom domain you apply for, as described under{" "}
                  <em>Keeping links safe</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cloudflare</strong> — delivers the web application and short links
                  (hosting/CDN). Your IP address reaches Cloudflare as part of normal traffic
                  delivery, and Cloudflare tells us which country it belongs to, which we keep only
                  as a daily count. Cloudflare also receives the names of custom domains, to issue their
                  certificates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Discord</strong> — so the admin sees moderation events quickly, hrva.cc
                  posts alerts to a private Discord channel that only the admin reads: when a link
                  is flagged for review, reported by a visitor or blocked automatically, when a bio
                  page is sent for review by the automatic text checks or reported by a visitor, when
                  someone signs up, when a blocklist fails to load or loads again, and when many new
                  links to the same new domain appear in a short time (a possible phishing wave). An
                  alert can include the short link, the domain it points to (never the full
                  address), the owner&apos;s account number (not their email address or name), the
                  reasons for the flag or block, and for a visitor report its category and the full
                  details, with anything that looks like an email or IP address removed. A bio page
                  alert names the page&apos;s handle (or its page number if it has none) and the
                  owner&apos;s account number, and adds the reasons the text checks found or, for a
                  visitor report, its category and the full details, cleaned the same way. The
                  page&apos;s display name and bio text are never sent. A sign-up alert shows only the
                  account number and whether the account uses email, Google or GitHub. A phishing-wave
                  alert names the domain and its age, if known, and counts
                  the new links and the different accounts or networks that made them, without
                  saying which ones. Every Monday the channel also gets the weekly summary:
                  site-wide totals for the past week, such as clicks, visitors, new links and users,
                  reviews and automatic blocks, how many reviews are still open, and the top 5 links
                  by clicks, each with its short link, the domain it points to and its click count.
                  Nothing in a message is cut short: when more alerts come in at once than fit in
                  one message, the rest aren&apos;t posted and the message ends with how many were
                  left out (&ldquo;and N more&rdquo;). When someone applies for a custom domain, the alert names
                  the domain, the account number and what the automatic checks found; when a custom domain is
                  turned off, needs the admin&apos;s attention or is missing from Cloudflare, it names the domain
                  and the reason. Discord Inc., based in the United States,
                  processes these messages under its own terms, and they stay in the channel until
                  the admin deletes them.
